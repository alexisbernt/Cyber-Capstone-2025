## Back-end Resources:
Using the "SQLite" Extension.

I asked ChatGPT how to do this: This was the reply:

Steps:
Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl + Shift + X).
Search for SQLite (Recommended extension: SQLite by alexcvzz).
Install the extension.
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P).
Search for and select "SQLite: Open Database".
Browse and select your .db file.
The database will open in the SQLite Explorer panel, where you can expand tables and run queries.
