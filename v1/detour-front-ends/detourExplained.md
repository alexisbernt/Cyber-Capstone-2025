# Detour Explained

On March 13th I decided I did not like the aestetic of my website so I watched an HTML and CSS tutorial by a guy who made a really pretty website. I then tried to take that code, convert it to JavaScript and then go from there. Not a super successful experience because HTML and Java (the React connections for Java versus the connections to connect elements to HTML) are very different. Live and learn.

Here is the pretty websites actual repo with all the features connected (just between HTML and css):
