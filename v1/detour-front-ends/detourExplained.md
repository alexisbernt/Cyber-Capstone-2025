# Detour Explained

On March 13th I decided I did not like the aestetic of my website so I watched an HTML and CSS tutorial by a guy who made a really pretty website. I then tried to take that code, convert it to JavaScript and then go from there. Not a super successful experience because HTML and Java (the React connections for Java versus the connections to connect elements to HTML) are very different. Live and learn.
