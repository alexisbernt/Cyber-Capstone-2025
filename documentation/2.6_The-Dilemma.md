## My computer broke during dead week

I had to get two loaner computers. Both had running scripts disabled. 

 PowerShell was blocking the execution of scripts, including the npm.ps1 script, due to a restrictive execution policy.

 So, I had to go in and Temporarily allow scripts by running: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

 ### For Front-end:

 Went to having neccessary packages installed: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d96752dc-4991-4f30-8e00-e45be0cbfa0f)

 Then was able to run npm install and npm start and I felt like a hella hacker nerd winner!

### For Back-end:

1. Ran npm install again (to install back-end dependencies)
2. Run node server.js
