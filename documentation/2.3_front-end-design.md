# Front-end Design 

4/8: Home screen ready 4/8 commit
- The only things that still need to be fixed = linking the "enter to win" component. Making that "enter to win" into a thumbnail width instead of a normal image width. Linking the bottom (about, contact, etc.) page. Maybe fix the computer image to have a white background. Otherwise I am fairly pleased with this aestetic.
