# Front-end Design 

4/8: Home screen ready 4/8 commit
- The only things that still need to be fixed = linking the "enter to win" component. Making that "enter to win" into a thumbnail width instead of a normal image width. Linking the bottom (about, contact, etc.) page. Maybe fix the computer image to have a white background. Otherwise I am fairly pleased with this aestetic. 

4/9: Module 1 screen (basic version) ready 4/9 commit
- The only things that still need to fixed and implemented are making sure that the buttons lead to links / work when clicked on. Design a "3-steps" text image that is aestetic. Link Blog 1 to the bottom (have a rolling display of all blog posts). Play with the text on the page a bit more. Verdana was used. For content text do a skinner longer text that is not bold. If time: Format and play around more with the matching game.
