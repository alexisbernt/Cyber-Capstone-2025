# Milk On The Floor and Lexi's Cyber Club Collaboration for Server Hosting 

Ability to maintain all of the data on servers in home lab. 

For testing, I have been using local host (port 3000 and port 3001). 

Origin points to front-end domain name. 

Back-end will be on server. Then code will have to hit server to get back-end information. You change the origin to the DNS name that points to server running in home. Pointing a domain name to the server that back-end is running on.

Front-end on the axois-post address is changed to point at the domain name that the server is running on. 

Using the Client-server model: Server sends files. Servers provide information to other computers called "clients" on a computer network.
