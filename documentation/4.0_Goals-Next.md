# Goals Going Forward 
 Some specific goals I have going forward include: 
 
 (A) Have consistent look to each page of the website. This includes consistent colors and flow. Consistent aesthetic (colors, styling, font). 
 
 (B) Be able to store all user data. Right now I have it where I can create an email list and have logins. It would be cool to store where each user left off (create levels with it). 
 
 (C) Be able to lock the learning modules so you have to complete them one by one. 
 
 (D) Get up to about 9 learning modules which will feature more advanced cybersecurity content. 
 
 Those are the initial next steps I can think of.

(ii) Ongoing scroll nav bar
