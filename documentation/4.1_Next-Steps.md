# Documentation and Progress Log of Next Steps on Lexi's Cyber Club

After the computer dilemma I had to do some coding on a outside loaner computer. Because of this I had to re-close the Cyber-Capstone-2025 repo. When cloning I had to recreate the react project. I did this by running:
- npm install react-scripts --save

CREATE A .gitignore file BEFORE running this command. Or else all of those node modules will try to be committed to GitHub Desktop and overwhelm.
