## My computer broke during dead week

I had to get two loaner computers. Both had running scripts disabled. 

 PowerShell was blocking the execution of scripts, including the npm.ps1 script, due to a restrictive execution policy.

 So, I had to go in and Temporarily allow scripts by running: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
